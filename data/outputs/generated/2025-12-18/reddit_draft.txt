**Title:** 🏀 The Hidden Hoopsters: Today's Top Under-the-Radar Fantasy Picks 🏀

Hey r/fantasybball fam! Today we're diving deep into the pool of overlooked players who might just be the diamond in the rough your fantasy team needs. Let's check out some of the best deep sleepers, waiver wire targets, and streaming candidates.

**1. Domantas Sabonis (PF/C - Indiana Pacers)** - Sabonis is projected to earn 46.0 fantasy points today. A force on the boards and a facilitator in the paint, the Pacers' big man is averaging a double-double. He's only rostered in about 20% of leagues, which means there's a good chance he's available in yours. Grab him for consistent production.

**2. Ja Morant (PG - Memphis Grizzlies)** - This high-flying point guard is only owned in about 35% of leagues and is projected to score 43.1 fantasy points today. Morant's explosive scoring ability combined with his knack for racking up assists makes him a sleeper pick who could pay off big time.

**3. LaMelo Ball (PG - Charlotte Hornets)** - Despite his high-profile name, LaMelo is only rostered in ~25% of leagues and is often overlooked due to his inconsistency. However, with his playmaking and scoring ability, he's a perfect streaming candidate against weaker defenses.

**4. Alex Sarr (PF/C - Free Agent)** - A recent free agent, Sarr's upside is huge. He's a great candidate for a streaming option if you're in a deeper league, and he's almost guaranteed to be available on your waiver wire.

**5. Cam Spencer (PG - Free Agent)** - Another free agent, Spencer's production has been on the rise lately. As a point guard, he offers a lot of potential for assists and steals, which could be valuable in category leagues. He's currently owned in less than 1% of leagues.

**Schedule Advantage:** The Pacers, Grizzlies, and Hornets all have a game today, providing immediate value for Sabonis, Morant, and Ball. Sarr and Spencer, as free agents, have the potential to be picked up by teams with favorable schedules.

Remember, these players are likely being overlooked, so act fast and don’t let these hidden gems slip through your fingers. Good luck, managers!
