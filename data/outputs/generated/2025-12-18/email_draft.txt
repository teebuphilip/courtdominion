Subject: Unearth Hidden Gems: Your Daily Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Guide - December 18, 2025

Hello Fantasy Managers,

Are you ready to make the most out of this fantasy season? We've got some deep sleepers who are poised to make a significant impact on your lineups. These are the hidden talents that aren't on everyone's radar, yet!

1. **Domantas Sabonis, Indiana Pacers (PF/C)**
Projected for a hefty 46.0 fantasy points, Sabonis is a solid bet. His rebounding and scoring abilities are often overlooked, but with a strong game against the Raptors, he proved that he's a force to reckon with. Expect bigger things from him moving forward as the Pacers' go-to option.

2. **Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies (PG)**
The high-flying point guard is projected to earn 43.1 fantasy points. He's an explosive scorer and a crafty playmaker who is taking his game to new heights this season. Look for Morant to have a breakout year as he continues to lead the Grizzlies.

3. **Alex Sarr, New Orleans Pelicans (PF)**
A deep sleeper for those in deeper leagues, Sarr is a high-upside play. His ability to stretch the floor and guard multiple positions makes him a valuable asset. He may not bring you those big numbers instantly, but he's a long-term investment that can pay off.

**Quick Streaming Notes**

- **Cam Spencer, Brooklyn Nets (PG/SG)**: Spencer is a sneaky play for those in need of assists and threes. He's been getting consistent minutes off the bench and can provide a nice boost in those categories.

- **Zach Edey, Detroit Pistons (C)**: If you're in need of rebounds and blocks, Edey is your man. The big man has been a force in the paint, and his role is only expected to grow.

Don't sleep on these players. Every point counts, and these are the guys who can push you over the top. Be sure to check them out and add them to your lineups!

Remember, it's not about who you draft, it's about who you pick up. Act fast, seize these opportunities, and outsmart your competition!

Keep ballin',
