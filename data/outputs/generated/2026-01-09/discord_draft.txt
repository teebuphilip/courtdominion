@everyone Morning managers! 🌞 Are you ready to have the edge over your competition? Let's talk about some **deep sleepers** and **waiver wire targets** for today's matchups.

Don't hit the snooze button on **LaMelo Ball** or **De'Aaron Fox**. They're sizzling with a solid 42.8 FP each, and they're not the only ones. **Zion Williamson** and **Karl-Anthony Towns** are close behind. These guys could be the **secret weapons** that take your team to victory.

Now, let's talk about the real gems: those high upside value plays. I'm looking at you, **KJ Simpson**, **Alex Sarr**, and **Cam Spencer**. They might not be the big names everyone's chasing, but their potential is through the roof. 🚀 Don't let them slip under your radar - they could be the difference makers in your lineup.

Remember, it's not just about the big names; it's about finding the under-the-radar players who can swing your matchup. Make sure to hit that waiver wire and consider these underappreciated contenders. 💎

Happy managing, folks! Let's see those W's. 🏀

Waiver Wire Targets: **LaMelo Ball, De'Aaron Fox, Zion Williamson, KJ Simpson, Alex Sarr, Cam Spencer**
