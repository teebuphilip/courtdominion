**Title:** *Deep Sleepers & Hidden Gems: Waiver Wire & Streaming Opportunities Await!*

Hello Fantasy Hoops Managers! It's time to dig deep into the waiver wire and discover those hidden gems that could tilt the scales in your favor. We're not talking about the obvious superstars, but the unheralded players primed for a breakout. 

**Deep Sleepers:**

1. **LaMelo Ball** (Ownership: 45%): Don't let the low ownership percentage fool you. Ball has been quietly putting up impressive numbers. He's averaging 42.8 FP and showing strong potential for more. He could be a game changer for your team with his high ceiling.

2. **De'Aaron Fox** (Ownership: 35%): Fox is another overlooked player who's been producing at an elite level. Like Ball, he's also averaging 42.8 FP. Given his low ownership, he's a perfect waiver wire target to boost your lineup.

3. **Zion Williamson** (Ownership: 60%): Williamson isn't getting the attention he deserves. He's not far behind Ball and Fox in terms of FP and has been consistently performing. His high upside makes him a great streaming target.

4. **Karl-Anthony Towns** (Ownership: 50%): Towns has been under the radar for a while now, but his recent performances suggest he could be on the brink of a breakout. Grab him while you can.

**High Upside Value Plays:**

1. **KJ Simpson** (Ownership: 15%): Simpson is a potential breakout candidate with a high ceiling. He's not on most manager's radar, which makes him a valuable addition to your lineup.

2. **Alex Sarr** (Ownership: 10%): Sarr is another high upside value play. He's been performing well recently and his low ownership makes him an attractive waiver wire target.

3. **Cam Spencer** (Ownership: 5%): Spencer is the ultimate deep sleeper. He's been showing promising signs and could be a great asset for your team if given the opportunity.

**Schedule Advantages:**

All the players mentioned above have favorable schedules in the coming weeks, with multiple games against teams that struggle defensively. This gives them more opportunities to rack up fantasy points.

Remember, the key to winning in fantasy hoops is to stay ahead of the curve. Act fast, pick up these hidden gems, and watch your team rise in the standings. Good luck!
