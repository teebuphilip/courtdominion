Hey everyone, :basketball: let's talk **waiver wire opportunities** and **deep sleepers**! 

First, turn your eyes towards **Domantas Sabonis**, **Ja Morant**, and **LaMelo Ball**. They're not the big names we usually drool over, but they're set to give us some serious value. Projections show these guys could hit 40+ FP, making them solid pickups for your lineup. :fire:

But wait, there's more! :eyes: If you're hunting for some high-ceiling value, I've got three names that might just put you over the top: **KJ Simpson**, **Alex Sarr**, and **Cam Spencer**. These guys are as deep as sleepers come, but with ceilings up to 33.3 FP, they could be the secret weapons you need. :muscle:

Remember, the early bird gets the worm, or in this case, the early manager gets the waiver wire gold. Make sure to add these players to your watchlist or pick them up before your rivals do. :trophy: 

That's all for now! If you've got any questions, feel free to drop them below. Let's crush it this season, team! :boom: 

Waiver Targets: **Domantas Sabonis**, **Ja Morant**, **LaMelo Ball**
