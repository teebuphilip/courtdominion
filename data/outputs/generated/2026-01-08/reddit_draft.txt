**Title:** Grab These Deep Sleepers NOW: Your Ultimate Waiver Wire & Streaming Guide for Today

Hey r/fantasybball, your favourite fantasy basketball analyst is back and ready to unveil some hidden treasures. This post is all about deep sleepers, waiver wire targets, and streaming opportunities you're probably overlooking. So, let’s dive in!

**1. Domantas Sabonis (PF/C, Sacramento Kings)**

Sabonis has quietly been piling up the fantasy points, averaging 18.7 PPG, 10.3 RPG, and 6.1 APG. The Kings’ heavy schedule this week makes him a prime streaming target. With an ownership of just 76%, he's likely available in your league.

**2. Ja Morant (PG, Memphis Grizzlies)**

Averaging a solid 24.0 PPG and 7.6 APG, Morant is a waiver wire steal. His explosive playmaking could provide a much-needed boost to your fantasy points. He's currently owned in only 70.5% of leagues, so act fast.

**3. LaMelo Ball (PG, Charlotte Hornets)**

Ball's all-round production (15.6 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 6.1 APG) makes him an attractive add. With multiple games this week, he's a prime streaming candidate. His ownership sits at a surprisingly low 68.5%, making now the perfect time to snag him.

**4. De'Aaron Fox (PG, Sacramento Kings)**

Fox is under the radar with an ownership of just 72.4%. With the Kings' packed schedule this week, his high-energy play (25.2 PPG) could be a game-changer for your team.

**5. Zion Williamson (PF, New Orleans Pelicans)**

Zion is a deep sleeper due to his injury status, but he's expected to return soon. His low ownership (62%) means he could be a great stash for the second half of the season. 

Don't forget, these players are likely available in your league and could provide a significant boost to your fantasy basketball team. So, don't snooze on these deep sleepers, waiver wire targets, and streaming candidates. Act now before your competitors catch on! 

Remember, fantasy basketball is all about staying ahead of the curve. Good luck, managers!
