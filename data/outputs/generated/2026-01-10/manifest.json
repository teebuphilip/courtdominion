  "narrative": "Seize the day with these overlooked fantasy gems! LaMelo Ball, De'Aaron Fox, and Bam Adebayo are primed to outperform their projections, making them the perfect deep sleeper candidates. Meanwhile, with ceilings of 21.1, 33.3, and 19.8 fantasy points respectively, KJ Simpson, Alex Sarr, and Cam Spencer are high upside value plays that many managers are neglecting. Don\u2019t miss out, snatch them off the waiver wire and plug them into your lineup for a potential big night. Remember, it's the deep sleepers and hidden values that win championships, not just the superstars!",
