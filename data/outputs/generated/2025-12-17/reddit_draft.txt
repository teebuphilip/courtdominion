**Title:** [Waiver Wire Goldmine] Don't Sleep on these Hidden Gems!

Hey r/fantasybball managers! We all know how Jokić and Dončić are expected to run the show tonight, but let's not overlook the diamonds in the rough that can give your team the edge it needs. Let's dive into the hidden gems of today's waiver wire and streaming opportunities:

**1. Victor Wembanyama** - This young gun has been showing flashes of brilliance lately, with a fantasy ceiling of 55.6. He's been steadily improving and looks ready to explode. He's a strong waiver wire target if available - don't let him sit there for long!

**2. Alex Sarr** - Sarr is another high-potential player who's projected to outperform his current standing. He's been putting up solid numbers and his recent performances indicate he could have a big game tonight. He's a great streaming option if you're looking for some added firepower.

**3. Cam Spencer** - Spencer is a lesser-known quantity but don't let that deter you. He's been showing promise in his recent games, and with a favorable matchup tonight, he's primed to exceed expectations. Consider him for a stream if you're in need of a risky, high-reward play.

**Schedule Advantages** - Keep an eye on teams playing back-to-back games or those with a heavy schedule this week. Players from these teams, like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Joel Embiid, are likely to get more opportunities to rack up those fantasy points.

**Waiver Wire Targets** - Aside from the aforementioned Wembanyama, Sarr, and Spencer, it's worth noting if Giannis Antetokounmpo is somehow available in your league, grab him immediately. He's a consistent performer who can single-handedly win you a week.

Remember, fantasy basketball is not just about the big names. It's about finding value where others might not look. Good luck, and may your waiver wire pickups lead you to victory!
