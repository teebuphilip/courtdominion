READ CAREFULLY — HARD REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Claude, the following rules apply to everything you build.
You must not deviate from these rules for ANY reason.

1. DO NOT ask clarifying questions.
2. DO NOT propose alternatives.
3. DO NOT redesign architecture.
4. DO NOT generate placeholder marketing text.
5. DO NOT hardcode ANY copy (all content comes from JSON in /content).
6. DO NOT change folder structures.
7. DO NOT rename files.
8. DO NOT create additional "improved" systems.
9. DO NOT ignore or reinterpret instructions.

If anything is unclear:
→ Refer to CLAUDE_COMPLETE_REQUIREMENTS.md
→ Refer to SHORT_ANSWERS_FOR_CLAUDE.md
→ Follow exactly what is written.

Your job is execution, not interpretation.
