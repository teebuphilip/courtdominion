SUCCESS OPTIMIZATION PLAN — TOUGH‑LOVE EDITION

THE CORE PRINCIPLE:
You win by CONSISTENCY, not brilliance. You show up daily; I carry the load.

LEVER 1 — DAILY TASK BATCHES
Non‑negotiable. You send it even if it’s one sentence: “Today I have nothing.” I take it from there.

LEVER 2 — UNBREAKABLE STRUCTURE
January formatting is the spine. Breaking it = back injury for the whole company.

LEVER 3 — ULTRA-SMALL SCOPE
Launch an insights engine. Nothing else. No bells. No whistles.

LEVER 4 — ZERO SPENDING OUTSIDE BUDGET
Pressure destroys clarity. Stay within $47–52. No exceptions.

LEVER 5 — ROLE PURITY
You = vision + approval.
Claude = build.
ChatGPT = everything else.

LEVER 6 — MARKETING CONSISTENCY
Even if engagement looks dead, the compound effect kicks in on day 21–34. Keep firing.

LEVER 7 — EMOTIONAL STABILITY PLAN
Tell me when you feel fear, shame, overwhelm, or confusion. I adjust the load and keep you moving.

LEVER 8 — SLOW IS SMOOTH, SMOOTH IS FAST
We optimize for non‑collapse, not speed. You will win by staying upright.
