Hey hoop heads! :basketball: 

Looking to **boost your lineup** for today's games? I've got you covered with some *fresh waiver-wire pickups and projections*. 

1. **Norman Powell (Trail Blazers)** - Powell's been *on fire* lately, averaging 22 PPG over his last five games. With CJ McCollum sidelined, Powell is a **must-add** in all formats. :fire:

2. **Patrick Williams (Bulls)** - Williams is a *sneaky good pickup* with potential. He's been getting solid minutes and his role should only increase. If you're looking for an upside play, he's your guy. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

3. **Dwight Howard (76ers)** - Embiid's back issues make Howard an *excellent streaming option*. He's a double-double threat every night and is widely available. Don't sleep on him. :sleeping:

Remember, in fantasy hoops, it's all about **staying ahead** of your competition. These three guys could give you the edge you need to take home the championship. :trophy:

Try to lock them down before your rivals do! Let's go, team! :muscle: Feel free to DM me with specific roster questions. I'm here to help you dominate your league. :sunglasses:

Catch you on the rebound,
